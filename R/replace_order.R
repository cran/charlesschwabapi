#' Replace Order for Specific Account
#'
#' Given the tokens object from the `get_authentication_tokens`
#' function, the encrypted account ID, and the order ID and the
#' request body, replace the specific order. Due to the complexity of the orders
#' that can be created/replaced, currently this function allows
#' maximum flexibility by not cultivating an easier solution
#' to building the request body and assumes the user passes
#' the appropriate JSON. Much like the `place_order` function,
#' it is strongly encouraged to look at the documentation (in this package and
#' on the Charles Schwab developer site) for how to build proper orders before
#' attempting to replace any. The user of this function assumes
#' all risk that trades could not be replaced (and then executed)
#' exactly as intended.
#'
#' @return Returns a numeric order number and a message informing the user if the order was successfully
#'         placed/created or if there was an error.
